Factoring is the process of finding what to multiply together to get an expression. It is like "splitting" an expression into a multiplication of simpler expressions. Factoring is an important concept in mathematics and is used in various fields, such as algebra, calculus, and number theory. Here are some examples of factoring:
•	Factor the expression 2x + 6:
•	Both 2 and 6 have a common factor of 2.
•	We can factor the whole expression into 2(x + 3).
•	Therefore, 2x + 6 has been factored into 2 and x + 3.
•	Factor the expression 3x^2 + 12x:
•	Firstly, 3 and 12 have a common factor of 3.
•	We can factor out 3 to obtain 3(x^2 + 4x).
•	Secondly, x^2 and 4x also share the variable x. Together that makes x:
•	We can factor the whole expression into 3x(x + 4).
•	Therefore, 3x^2 + 12x has been factored into 3x and x + 4.
•	Factor the expression x^2 - 4:
•	This expression is a difference of squares, which can be factored into (x + 2)(x - 2).
•	Therefore, x^2 - 4 has been factored into (x + 2) and (x - 2).

Factoring can be used to simplify expressions, solve equations, and find roots of polynomials. It is also the opposite of expanding, which involves multiplying out expressions. Factoring can be done using different methods, such as factoring by grouping, factoring trinomials, factoring by completing the square, and factoring the difference of squares. Factoring is an important skill in algebra and is used in many applications in science, engineering, and finance.
Common Factoring Techniques:

There are several common factoring techniques in math, including:
•	Factoring out a common factor: This technique involves finding a factor that is common to all the terms in an expression and factoring it out. For example, the expression 2x + 2y + ax + ay can be factored into 2(x + y) + a(x + y), where (x + y) is the common factor.
•	Factoring the difference of squares: This technique involves factoring an expression of the form a^2 - b^2 into (a + b)(a - b). For example, the expression x^2 - 4 can be factored into (x + 2)(x - 2).
•	Factoring trinomials: This technique involves factoring an expression of the form ax^2 + bx + c into two binomials of the form (mx + n)(px + q). There are different methods to factor trinomials, such as factoring by grouping, factoring by trial and error, and factoring using the quadratic formula. For example, the expression x^2 + 5x + 6 can be factored into (x + 2)(x + 3).
•	Factoring by grouping: This technique involves grouping the terms in an expression into pairs and factoring out a common factor from each pair. For example, the expression 2x + 2y + ax + ay can be factored into 2(x + y) + a(x + y), and then further factored into (2 + a)(x + y).
•	Factoring the sum or difference of cubes: This technique involves factoring an expression of the form a^3 + b^3 or a^3 - b^3 into (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) or (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2), respectively. For example, the expression x^3 + 8 can be factored into (x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 4).
