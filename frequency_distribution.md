A frequency distribution is a way of organizing data to show how often each value or range of values occurs in a dataset. It can be displayed in a graphical or tabular form, and it gives a visual display of the frequency of items. A frequency distribution table is a chart that shows the frequency of each item or range of items in a dataset. For example, a frequency distribution table can be used to show the number of students who scored different grades in a test, with the grades listed in one column and the frequency of students who scored each grade listed in another column. Another example is a frequency distribution table that shows the number of people who fall into different age groups, with the age groups listed in one column and the frequency of people in each age group listed in another column. Frequency distributions are useful for summarizing and analyzing data, and they can help to identify patterns and trends in the data. They are commonly used in various fields, such as statistics, finance, and social sciences.
