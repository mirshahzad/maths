Solving linear equations involves finding the value of the variable that makes the equation true. Linear equations are equations with degree 1, meaning that the variable is raised to the first power. Here are the steps to solve linear equations:

1.	Simplify both sides of the equation by combining like terms.

2.	Isolate the variable term on one side of the equation by performing inverse operations on both sides of the equation. Inverse operations are operations that undo each other, such as addition and subtraction, or multiplication and division.

3.	Check the solution by plugging it back into the original equation to make sure that it makes the equation true.

Here is an example of solving a linear equation:
Solve for x: 2x + 3 = 7
1.	Simplify both sides of the equation by combining like terms: 2x = 4
2.	Isolate the variable term by dividing both sides by 2: x = 2
3.	Check the solution by plugging it back into the original equation: 2(2) + 3 = 7, which is true.

There are different methods to solve linear equations, such as substitution, elimination, cross multiplication, and graphical methods. However, the basic steps are the same for all methods.
