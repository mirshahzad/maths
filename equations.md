•	An equation is a mathematical statement that shows that two expressions are equal. For example, 2x + 3 = 7 is an equation that shows that the expression 2x + 3 is equal to 7 when x is equal to 2.

•	Equations can be solved by performing the same operation on both sides of the equation to isolate the variable. For example, to solve the equation 2x + 3 = 7, we can subtract 3 from both sides to obtain 2x = 4, and then divide both sides by 2 to obtain x = 2.
