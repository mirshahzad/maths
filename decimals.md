Decimals are a way of representing numbers that are not whole. They are written using a decimal point to separate the whole number part from the fractional part. The whole number part represents the number of whole units, while the fractional part represents the part of a unit. Here are some examples of decimals:
Tenths: A decimal that has one digit after the decimal point represents tenths. For example, 0.5 represents half of a unit, or 5 tenths.
Hundredths: A decimal that has two digits after the decimal point represents hundredths. For example, 0.25 represents a quarter of a unit, or 25 hundredths.
Thousandths: A decimal that has three digits after the decimal point represents thousandths. For example, 0.125 represents one eighth of a unit, or 125 thousandths.
To solve decimals, there are several methods and tools available. Here are some steps to solve decimals:
Addition and Subtraction of Decimals: To add or subtract decimals, simply line up the decimal points and add or subtract the digits in each place value. For example, to solve 1.2 + 0.3, we line up the decimal points and add the digits in the tenths place, which gives us 1.5.
Multiplication of Decimals: To multiply decimals, ignore the decimal points and multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Then, count the total number of digits to the right of the decimal point in the factors and place the decimal point in the product that many places from the right. For example, to solve 1.2 x 0.3, we multiply 12 x 3 to get 36, and then place the decimal point two places from the right, which gives us 0.36.
Division of Decimals: To divide decimals, move the decimal point in the divisor to the right until it becomes a whole number. Then, move the decimal point in the dividend the same number of places to the right. Finally, divide the numbers as if they were whole numbers. For example, to solve 1.2 รท 0.3, we move the decimal point in 0.3 one place to the right to get 3, and then move the decimal point in 1.2 one place to the right to get 12. We can then divide 12 by 3 to get 4.
Decimal Calculator: There are many online decimal calculators available that can help solve decimals. For example, Khan Academy and Calculator Soup are two websites that offer decimal calculators. These calculators can add, subtract, multiply, and divide decimals, and show the steps to solve the problem.
