A derivative represents the rate of change of a function with respect to its variable. It provides crucial information about the behavior of functions and is fundamental in calculus. Here are some examples of derivatives and their applications:
1. Derivative of a Function:
•	The derivative of a function \( f(x) \) with respect to \( x \) is denoted by \( f'(x) \) or \( \frac{{df}}{{dx}} \).
•	Example: The derivative of \( f(x) = 3x^2 \) is \( f'(x) = 6x \).
2. Derivative Rules:
•	Various rules, such as the power rule, product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule, are used to find derivatives of different functions.
•	Example: The derivative of \( \sin(x) \) is \( \cos(x) \), and the derivative of \( x^3 \) is \( 3x^2 \).
3. Real-life Applications:
•	Derivatives are used to analyze motion, such as finding velocity and acceleration from displacement functions.
•	Example: The derivative of the displacement function of an object gives its velocity, and the second derivative gives its acceleration.
Derivatives play a crucial role in understanding the behavior of functions and have practical applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and finance. They provide insights into the rate of change and are essential for solving real-world problems involving dynamic systems and quantities.
