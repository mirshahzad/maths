What are Alpha, Beta, and Gamma?
Alpha, Beta, and Gamma are Greek letters and are generally used in math to denote constants’ values for expressions, such as polynomials’ roots.

Polynomials: A polynomial is defined as an expression that is composed of variables, constants, and exponents that are combined using mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (No division operation by a variable).

Polynomials Roots: Roots of a polynomial refer to the values of a variable for which the given polynomial is equal to zero. If a is the root of the polynomial p(x), then p(a) = 0.
