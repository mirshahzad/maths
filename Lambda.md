Lambda, the 11th letter of the Greek alphabet (λ), is used as both a symbol and a concept in various fields of science, mathematics and computing.
In mathematics and computer programming, the lambda symbol introduces the “anonymous function.” Lambda notation distinguishes between variables used as mathematical arguments and variables that stand for predefined values.
