Newton's Method is an iterative algorithm for approximating the roots of a function. It is based on the idea that if we have an initial guess for a root of a function, we can use the tangent line at that point to find a better approximation. We repeat this process until we get an approximation that is accurate enough for our purposes.

A practical example of Newton's Method can be illustrated with the function ( f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5 ). We want to find a root of this function, which is a value of ( x ) such that ( f(x) = 0 ). We start with an initial guess of ( x_0 = 2 ). The tangent line to the graph of ( f(x) ) at ( x_0 = 2 ) is given by:
y = f’(x0)(x – x0) + f(x0)

The derivative of (f(x)) is (f’(x) = 3 x^2 -2), so (f’(2) = 8). The tangent line is therefore:
y = 8(x-2) + f(2) = 8x – 11

We find the x-intercept of this line by setting (y=0):
8x – 11 = 0 => x = 11/8

This is our first approximation for a root of (f(x)). We repeat the process with this new value of (x) as our initial guess:
X1 = 11/8

The tangent line to the graph of (f(x)) at (x_1 = \frac{11}{8}) is given by:
Y = f’ (x1)(x-x1) + f(x1)

The derivative of (f(x) is (f’(x) = 3x^2 – 2), so (f’(\frac{11}{8} = \frac{105}{32}). The tangent line is therefore:
y = 105/32 (x-11/8) + f(11/8) = 105/32 x – 527/256

We find the x-intercept of this line by setting (y=0):
105/32 x – 527/256 = 0 => x ≈ 2.094 

This is our second approximation for a root of (f(x)). We can continue this process to get even better approximations for the root of (f(x)).

Newton’s method has practical applications in various fields, such as physics, engineering, and economics, where it can be used to solve equations that cannot be solved analytically.
