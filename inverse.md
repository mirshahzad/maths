In mathematics, the inverse of a function or operation is a function or operation that reverses the effect of the original function or operation. For example, the inverse operation of addition is subtraction, and the inverse operation of multiplication is division. The inverse of a number is the reciprocal of the number, which is 1 divided by the number. The inverse of a function exists only if the function is bijective, meaning that each element in the range corresponds to exactly one element in the domain.

Here is an example: 
â€¢	Find the inverse of the function f(x) = 2x + 3. 

To find the inverse of the function, we need to switch the x and y variables and solve for y. 
y = 2x + 3 
x = 2y + 3 
x - 3 = 2y 
y = (x - 3) / 2 

Therefore, the inverse of the function f(x) = 2x + 3 is f^-1(x) = (x - 3) / 2.
