In mathematics, a series is the sum of the terms of a sequence. A sequence is an ordered list of numbers or elements that follow a specific pattern. A series can be finite, meaning it has a specific number of terms, or infinite, meaning it continues indefinitely. Series can be described in different ways, such as an explicit formula, a recurrence relation, or a table of values.

Here are some examples of series:
•	Finite series: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. This series has five terms and ends with the number 5.
•	Infinite series: 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... This series goes on forever and has a common ratio of 1/2 between each term.
•	Arithmetic series: 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 + 18 + ... This series has a common difference of 3 between each term, and it can be generated by adding a fixed constant to the previous term.
•	Geometric series: 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + ... This series has a common ratio of 3 between each term, and it can be generated by multiplying the previous term by a fixed constant.

Series have many applications in mathematics, physics, and engineering. For example, they are used to calculate the value of pi, to model the behavior of electrical circuits, and to approximate the solutions of differential equations.
