A pie chart is a circular-shaped chart that visually demonstrates the part-whole relationship of categorical data variables. It is a type of graph that records data in a circular manner that is further divided into sectors for representing the data of that particular part out of the whole part. Each slice in the pie chart represents a category, and the size of each slice indicates the proportion of the whole that each category represents. Pie charts are suited for comparing multiple categories or showing part-to-whole relationships in a single data set. They are commonly used in various industries, such as sales, education, and business. For example, accountants use pie charts to compare the quantity of sales for various products in a store or profit growth for a business in different months. Teachers use them to visualize the time for each lesson period or show how many students scored each grade in a test. Pie charts are easy to create and interpret, but they have some limitations. They are best used for nominal or categorical data, and when there are many levels to the variable, a bar chart or packed bar chart may provide a better visualization of the data. Pie charts should also be avoided when values for a parts-to-whole relationship are very similar, as it can be difficult to distinguish between similarly sized categories.
