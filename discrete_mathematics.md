Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that can be considered "discrete" rather than "continuous." It encompasses a wide range of topics, including set theory, graph theory, logic, permutation, combination, sequences, and series. Here are some examples of these topics:

(i) Set Theory: Set theory is the study of collections of objects, called sets, and the operations performed on them. Examples of set operations include union, intersection, and difference. For example, consider the sets A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 4}. The union of these sets is A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4}, and the intersection is A ∩ B = {2, 3}.

(ii) Graph Theory: Graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. For example, consider a social network where nodes represent people, and edges represent friendships. This can be represented as a graph, where nodes are vertices and edges are edges.

(iii) Logic: Logic is the study of statements, arguments, and deductions in mathematics. It includes topics such as propositional logic, predicate logic, and modal logic. For example, the logical statement "If it rains, then I will stay at home" can be represented as "R ⟹ H" in propositional logic.

(iv) Permutation: Permutation is the study of arrangements of objects, such as rearranging letters in a word or numbers in a sequence. For example, consider a set of three letters {a, b, c}. The number of ways to arrange these letters is 3! (3 factorial), which is equal to 3 × 2 × 1 = 6.

(v) Combination: Combination is the study of selecting subsets from a larger set. For example, consider a set of five people, and we want to know how many ways to choose a subset of three people. This problem can be solved using the combination formula, which is given by
(n¦k) = n! / k!(n – k)!’, where n is the size of the set and k is the size of the subset.

(vi) Sequence: A sequence is an ordered list of objects, such as numbers, letters, or symbols. For example, the sequence {a, b, c, d} is a list of four elements. Sequences are used in various areas of mathematics, including number theory, combinatorics, and probability.

(vii) Series: A series is the sum of a sequence of numbers or other mathematical objects. For example, the sum of the first n positive integers can be represented as the series ∑(n) = n(n+1)/2. Series are used in various areas of mathematics, including analysis, combinatorics, and probability.
