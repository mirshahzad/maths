System of Linear Equations
A system of linear equations is a collection of one or more linear equations involving the same variables. A linear equation is an equation for a line, and it is not always in the form y = mx + b. It can also be like y = 0.5(7 - x) or like y + 0.5x = 3.5 or like y + 0.5x - 3.5 = 0 and more. A system of linear equations is when we have two or more linear equations working together. For example, the system of equations |2x| + |y| = 5 and -x + |y| = 2 is a system of linear equations. The goal is to find the values of x and y that make both equations true at once.

There are different methods to solve systems of linear equations, such as substitution, elimination, and matrix methods. Here are some examples of solving systems of linear equations:

1.	Solve the system of equations:
•	2x + y = 5
•	x - y = 1
•	Solution: Add the two equations to eliminate y and obtain x = 2. Substitute x = 2 into either equation to obtain y = 3. Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is (2, 3).

2.	Solve the system of equations:
•	3x - 2y = 4
•	2x + y = 5
•	Solution: Multiply the second equation by 2 to obtain 4x + 2y = 10. Add the two equations to eliminate y and obtain 7x = 14. Divide both sides by 7 to obtain x = 2. Substitute x = 2 into either equation to obtain y = 1. Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is (2, 1).

3.	Solve the system of equations:
•	2x + 3y + z = 7
•	x - y + 2z = 4
•	3x + 2y - z = 1
•	Solution: Use elimination to eliminate z. Add the first and second equations to obtain 3x + 2y = 11. Subtract twice the second equation from the third equation to obtain 5x + 5y = -7. Divide both sides by 5 to obtain x + y = -7/5. Substitute x + y = -7/5 into 3x + 2y = 11 to obtain x = 1 and y = -12/5. Substitute x = 1 and y = -12/5 into any of the equations to obtain z = 2. Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is (1, -12/5, 2).
