In mathematics, the domain of a function is the set of input values for which the function is defined. It is the set of all possible values of the independent variable that can be plugged into the function to produce a valid output. The range of a function is the set of all possible output values that the function can produce. Here are some examples to help understand the concept of domain:

Function f(x) = x^2: The domain of this function is all real numbers because any real number can be squared to produce a valid output. Therefore, the domain is (-∞, ∞).

Function g(x) = 1/x: The domain of this function is all real numbers except for x = 0 because division by zero is undefined. Therefore, the domain is (-∞, 0) U (0, ∞).

Function h(x) = √(x-2): The domain of this function is all real numbers greater than or equal to 2 because the square root of a negative number is undefined in the real number system. Therefore, the domain is [2, ∞).

Function j(x) = ln(x): The domain of this function is all positive real numbers because the natural logarithm of a non-positive number is undefined. Therefore, the domain is (0, ∞).

Function k(x) = 1/(x-3): The domain of this function is all real numbers except for x = 3 because division by zero is undefined. Therefore, the domain is (-∞, 3) U (3, ∞).
