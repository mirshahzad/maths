Implicit differentiation is a technique used to find the derivative of an implicit function, which is a function that cannot be easily solved for one of its variables. Instead, the function is expressed as an equation involving both variables. The process of implicit differentiation involves differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to the independent variable, treating the dependent variable as a function of the independent variable. Here are some examples of implicit differentiation:
Example 1:
Find the derivative of the equation ( x^2 + y^2 = 25) with respect to ( x ).
Solution:
•	Differentiating both sides with respect to ( x), we get ( 2x + 2y dy/dx = 0).
•	Solving for (dy / dx), we get (dy / dx = - xy).
•	Thus, the derivative of the equation with respect to ( x) is (dy / dx = - xy).
Example 2:
Find the derivative of the equation ( x^2y + sin(xy) = 1) with respect to ( x).
Solution:
•	Differentiating both sides with respect to ( x), we get ( 2xy + x^2 dy / dx + cos(xy) (y + xy') = 0 \).
•	Solving for ( dy / dx ), we get ( dy / dx = -2xy + cos(xy) (y + xy')  x^2 + cos(xy)).
•	Thus, the derivative of the equation with respect to ( x ) is ( dy / dx = -2xy + cos(xy) (y + xy') x^2 + cos(xy)).
These examples illustrate the process of implicit differentiation and demonstrate how it can be used to find the derivative of an implicit function. Implicit differentiation is a powerful tool in calculus and is widely used in various fields, including physics, engineering, and economics.
Implicit Function:
An implicit function is a function that is defined by an implicit equation, where one of the variables is not explicitly expressed in terms of the other variables. In other words, an implicit function is a relation in which the dependent variable is not isolated on one side of the equation. For example, the equation of the unit circle, \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\), defines \(y\) as an implicit function of \(x\) within the specified range of \(x\), and \(y\) is restricted to nonnegative values.
In general, any function obtained by taking a relation \(f(x, y) = g(x, y)\) and solving for \(y\) is called an implicit function for that relation. An example of an implicit function is an equation like \(x^2 + y^2 + 4xy + 25 = 0\), where the dependent variable 'y' and the independent variable 'x' cannot be easily separated to represent it as a function of the form \(y = f(x)\).
Implicit functions are often used in cases where it is not possible or convenient to express the dependent variable explicitly in terms of the independent variable. They are prevalent in multivariable calculus and are essential in various mathematical and real-world applications, especially when dealing with complex relationships between variables.
Difference between Implicit and Explicit:
Implicit differentiation and explicit differentiation are two different methods used to find the derivative of a function. Explicit differentiation is used to find the derivative of an explicit function, where one variable is defined completely in terms of the other. In contrast, implicit differentiation is used to find the derivative of an implicit function, where the variables are not explicitly defined in terms of each other. Instead, the function is expressed as an equation involving both variables.
For example, the equation of a circle, \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), is an implicit function because it cannot be easily solved for one of its variables. In contrast, the function \( y = 3x^2 + 2x + 1 \) is an explicit function because it can be solved for \( y \) in terms of \( x \).
The process of explicit differentiation involves finding the derivative of an explicit function using the usual rules of differentiation. In contrast, the process of implicit differentiation involves differentiating both sides of an equation with respect to the independent variable, treating the dependent variable as a function of the independent variable.
In summary, the main difference between implicit and explicit differentiation is the type of function being differentiated. Explicit differentiation is used for explicit functions, while implicit differentiation is used for implicit functions.
