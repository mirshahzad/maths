The square root of a number is the number that, when multiplied by itself, given the original number.
For example, the square root of 25 is 5 because the integers 5 and – 5 multiplied by themselves, give the product 25.
√25	= 5

Difference between Square and Square Root:
Squares are the numbers, generated after multiplying a value by itself. Whereas, the square root of a number is a value which on getting multiplied by itself gives the original value. Hence, both are vice-versa methods. For example, the square of 2 is 4 and the square root of 4 is 2.
