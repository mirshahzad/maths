The definition of a proof is the logical way in which mathematicians demonstrate that a statement is true. 
In general, these statements are known as theorems and lemmas. 
A theorem is a declaration that can be determined to be true using mathematical operations and arguments. 
On the other hand, a lemma is like a smaller theorem that is used to prove a much greater theorem is true.
An example of a proof is for the theorem “suppose that a, b, and n are whole numbers. If n does not divide a times b, then n does not divide a and b.” For proof by contrapositive, suppose that n divides a or b. Then n certainly divides a times b, since it divides one of its factors. Thus, the contrapositive is true, and the theorem holds true.
