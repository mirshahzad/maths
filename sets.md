Some common types of sets in mathematics include:

Singleton Sets: A set that has only one element is called a singleton set. For example, the set {13} is a singleton set.

Null or Empty Sets: A set that does not contain any element is called a null or an empty set. It is denoted by the symbol "ϕ" and is read as "phi". For example, the set of integers between 1 and 2 is an empty set.

Equal Sets: Two sets are said to be equal if they have the same elements. For example, the sets {1, 2, 3} and {3, 2, 1} are equal sets.

Universal Sets: A set that contains all the elements of other sets is called a universal set. It is usually represented as 'U'. For example, if set A = {1, 2, 3}, set B = {2, 3, 4}, and set C = {3, 4, 5}, then the universal set would be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.



Sets can be operated on using various set operations, such as union, intersection, complement, and difference. Some common set symbols used in mathematics include:

Union Symbol: The union of two sets A and B is denoted by A ∪ B. It represents the set of all elements that are in A or B or both.

Intersection Symbol: The intersection of two sets A and B is denoted by A ∩ B. It represents the set of all elements that are in both A and B.

Subset Symbol: The subset symbol is denoted by ⊆. It represents that all the elements of set A are also present in set B. For example, if A = {1, 2} and B = {1, 2, 3}, then A ⊆ B.

Complement Symbol: The complement of a set A is denoted by A'. It represents the set of all elements that are not in A. For example, if A = {1, 2, 3}, then A' would be the set of all elements that are not in A.

Element of Symbol: The element of symbol is denoted by ∈. It represents that an element is present in a set. For example, if A = {1, 2, 3}, then 2 ∈ A.

Not Element of Symbol: The not element of symbol is denoted by ∉. It represents that an element is not present in a set. For example, if A = {1, 2, 3}, then 4 ∉ A.
