A line graph is a type of graph that displays data as a series of points connected by straight lines. It is used to represent quantitative data collected over a specific subject and a specific time interval. Line graphs are commonly used to show trends over time, such as changes in temperature, stock prices, or population growth. For example, a line graph can be used to show the temperature changes throughout the day, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing temperature. Another example is a line graph that shows the sales of a company over a period of time, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing sales. Line graphs are useful for identifying trends and patterns in data, and they can help to make predictions about future trends. However, they are not suitable for displaying data that is not continuous, such as categorical data. Line graphs are easy to read and interpret, and they are commonly used in various fields, such as business, economics, and science.
