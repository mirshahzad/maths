Negation is the process of finding the opposite of a given mathematical statement. 
It is denoted by the symbol "~" or "Â¬". 
The negation of a statement is the opposite of the given statement. For example, if the given statement is "Arjun's dog has a black tail", then the negation of the given statement is "Arjun's dog does not have a black tail". The working rule for obtaining the negation of a statement is as follows:
  i.	Write the given statement with "not".
  ii.	Make suitable modifications if the statements involve the word "All" and "Some".

To negate a statement of the form "If A, then B", we should replace it with the statement "A and Not B". For example, the statement "If I am rich, then I am happy" can be negated as "I am rich and not happy". The negation of a statement is useful in logic and mathematical reasoning to determine the opposite of a given statement.
