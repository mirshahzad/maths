An exponential function is a mathematical function of the form f(x) = bx, where b is a constant called the base, and x is the variable. Exponential functions are used to model situations that involve growth or decay, such as population growth, radioactive decay, and compound interest. Here are some examples of exponential functions:
•	f(x) = 2x: This is an example of an exponential growth function with a base of 2. As x increases, the function grows rapidly, as illustrated by its graph.
•	g(x) = (1/2)x: This is an example of an exponential decay function with a base of 1/2. As x increases, the function gets rapidly smaller, as illustrated by its graph.
•	h(x) = 3e2x: This is an example of an exponential growth function with a base of e, which is approximately equal to 2.71828. The function grows even faster than an exponential function with a base of 2, as illustrated by its graph.
•	k(x) = 4(3)-0.5x: This is an example of an exponential decay function with a base of 3 raised to the power of -0.5x. The function gets smaller as x increases, but not as rapidly as an exponential function with a base of 1/2.

To graph an exponential function, we can choose some values for x and then determine the corresponding y-values. Because exponents are defined for any real number, we can sketch the graph using a continuous curve through these given points. It is important to note that as x approaches negative infinity, the results become very small but never actually attain zero. The domain of any exponential function is the set of all real numbers, and the range consists of positive values bounded by a horizontal asymptote at y = 0. Exponential functions can be used in many contexts, such as finance, population growth, and radioactive decay. The natural exponential function, f(x) = ex, is a particularly important function in mathematics, and it is used in many applications.
