Continuity in mathematics refers to the smooth and uninterrupted behavior of a function. In real life, continuity can be observed in various phenomena, and a notable example is the concept's application in digital recording technology, such as CDs and DVDs. When using a digital recording device to record sound, the input signal, which represents the sound, is treated as a continuous function. Although the device cannot capture the sound at every moment in time due to the infinite nature of time, it can record small segments of the sound multiple times per second. This process allows for the faithful reproduction of the original sound, demonstrating the practical application of continuity in real-world technology.
Another real-life example of continuity can be found in the measurement of physical quantities. For instance, when measuring the temperature of an ice cube submerged in warm water, the process involves observing the gradual change in temperature over time. The temperature transition is a continuous process, and the principles of continuity are implicitly at play in this scenario. Similarly, continuity is essential in measuring the strength of magnetic and electric fields, as well as in determining the amount of a new compound formed from the reaction of two chemicals. These examples illustrate how continuity is not only a fundamental concept in mathematics but also a practical and pervasive aspect of real-world phenomena.

Here are some examples of checking the continuity of functions along with their solutions:
Example 1:
Check the continuity of the function \( f(x) = 3x - 7 \) at \( x = 7 \).
Solution: 
•	Given \( f(x) = 3x - 7 \) and \( x = 7 = a \).
•	We find the limit \( \lim_{{x \to a}} f(x) \).

Example 2:
Check the continuity of the function \( f(x) = 3x + 2 \) at \( x = 1 \).
Solution:
•	Given \( f(x) = 3x + 2 \).
•	Substituting \( x = 1 \) in \( f(x) \), we get \( f(1) = 3(1) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 \).
•	Thus, the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at all real numbers less than 1.
•	When \( x > 1 \), \( f(x) = x - 2 \).
•	Consider \( c > 1 \) and \( f(c) = c - 2 \).
•	Thus, the function \( f(x) \) is continuous at all real numbers greater than 1.
•	When \( x = 1 \), \( f(x) = x + 2 \).
•	Consider \( c = 1 \), and find the left-hand and right-hand limits.
•	The left-hand limit is not equal to the right-hand limit. Thus, the function \( f(x) \) is not continuous at \( x = 1 \).
