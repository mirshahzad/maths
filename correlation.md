Correlation is a statistical measure that indicates the degree to which two different entities are related to each other. It measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. Correlation studies are widely used in various fields, including psychology, economics, and health, to understand the relationships between different factors or variables. There are three possible outcomes of correlation studies: positive correlation, negative correlation, and zero correlation.
Real-life examples of correlation include:
(i)	Positive Correlation:
•	Education Level and Income: Individuals with higher levels of education tend to earn higher incomes.
•	Car Speed and Accident Risk: As car speed increases, the likelihood and severity of accidents tend to rise.
•	Temperature and Ice Cream Sales: As the temperature goes up, ice cream sales also go up.
•	Height and Weight: Taller individuals tend to weigh more, showing a positive correlation.
(ii)	Negative Correlation:
•	Time Spent Running vs. Body Fat: The more time spent running, the lower the body fat tends to be.
•	Time Spent Watching TV vs. Exam Scores: The more time spent watching TV, the lower the exam scores tend to be.
(iii)	Zero Correlation:
•	Coffee Consumption vs. Intelligence: There is no correlation between coffee consumption and intelligence.
•	Shoe Size vs. Number of Movies Watched: The shoe size of individuals and the number of movies they watch per year have a correlation of zero.
