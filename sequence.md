In mathematics, a sequence is an ordered list of numbers or elements that follow a specific pattern. Each element in the sequence is called a term, and it has a position in the sequence, such as first, second, third, and so on. Sequences can be finite, meaning they have a specific number of terms, or infinite, meaning they continue indefinitely. Sequences can be described in different ways, such as an explicit formula, a recurrence relation, or a table of values.

Here are some examples of sequences:
•	Finite sequence: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. This sequence has five terms and ends with the number 9.
•	Infinite sequence: 2, 5, 8, 11, ... This sequence goes on forever and has a common difference of 3 between each term.
•	Arithmetic sequence: 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, ... This sequence has a common difference of 3 between each term, and it can be generated by adding a fixed constant to the previous term.
•	Geometric sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ... This sequence has a common ratio of 2 between each term, and it can be generated by multiplying the previous term by a fixed constant.

Sequences have many applications in mathematics, computer science, and other fields. For example, they are used to model population growth, financial investments, and data compression algorithms.
