The mode in statistics refers to the number in a set of numbers that appears the most often. For example, in the set {1, 1, 3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8}, the mode is 7, as it appears the most out of all the numbers in the set. Another example is the set {3, 3, 6, 9, 15, 15, 15, 27, 27, 37, 48}, where the mode is 15, as it appears more frequently than any other number in the set. A set of numbers can have more than one mode, known as bimodal if there are two modes, or multimodal if there are more than two modes, when multiple numbers occur with equal frequency and more times than the others in the set. If no number in a set of numbers occurs more than once, that set has no mode. The mode is easy to understand and calculate, and it is not affected by extreme values. It is useful for qualitative data and can be computed in an open-ended frequency table. The mode is represented by the symbol XÌ„ and is calculated by finding the number that appears most often in a set of observations.
