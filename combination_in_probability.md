In probability, a combination is a selection of items from a larger set, where the order of selection does not matter. It is denoted by "n choose r" or (n¦r), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be chosen. The formula for combination is given by:
(n¦r) = n!/r!(n-r)!
Where:
	n is the total number of items
	r is the number of items to be chosen
	! denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number
For example, if you have 5 different books and you want to choose 3 to read over the weekend, the number of ways to choose 3 books from 5 is given by (5¦3)  = 5!/3!(5-3)!= 10.
Combinations are used in various probability problems, such as in counting the number of ways to form a certain group or to calculate the probability of certain events occurring.
