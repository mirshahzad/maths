The Rectangular Coordinate System and Graphs

The rectangular coordinate system is a two-dimensional plane consisting of the x-axis and the y-axis, which are perpendicular to each other and divide the plane into four sections called quadrants. Each point in the plane is defined as an ordered pair (x, y), where x is determined by its horizontal distance from the origin and y is determined by its vertical distance from the origin. Graphs are used to display data visually, and a line graph consists of a set of related data values graphed on a coordinate plane and connected by line segments. Here are some examples to help understand the concept of the rectangular coordinate system and graphs:

Plotting points: To plot a point on the rectangular coordinate system, we use the ordered pair (x, y) to locate the point in the plane. For example, the point (2, 3) is located 2 units to the right of the origin and 3 units above the origin. Similarly, the point (-4, -1) is located 4 units to the left of the origin and 1 unit below the origin.

Graphing equations: To graph an equation in the plane, we can create a table of values and plot points. For example, to graph the equation y = 2x + 1, we can choose values of x and calculate the corresponding values of y. Then, we can plot the points (0, 1), (1, 3), (-1, -1), etc. and connect them with a straight line to obtain the graph of the equation.

Finding intercepts: The x-intercept of a graph is the point where the graph intersects the x-axis, and the y-intercept is the point where the graph intersects the y-axis. To find the intercepts, we can set x or y equal to zero and solve for the other variable. For example, to find the x-intercept of the graph of y = 2x - 4, we can set y = 0 and solve for x to obtain x = 2. Therefore, the x-intercept is (2, 0).

Distance between points: The distance between two points in the plane can be calculated using the distance formula: d = √((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). For example, the distance between the points (2, 3) and (-4, -1) is d = √((-4 - 2)^2 + (-1 - 3)^2) = √(36 + 16) = √52.
