•	An inequality is a mathematical statement that shows that two expressions are not equal. For example, 2x + 3 < 7 is an inequality that shows that the expression 2x + 3 is less than 7 when x is less than 2.

•	Inequalities can be solved by performing the same operation on both sides of the inequality to isolate the variable. However, when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, the direction of the inequality must be reversed. For example, to solve the inequality 2x + 3 < 7, we can subtract 3 from both sides to obtain 2x < 4, and then divide both sides by 2 to obtain x < 2.

•	Linear inequality in two variables: 2x + 3y < 12. Solution: To graph this inequality, we can first graph the line 2x + 3y = 12 by finding its x- and y-intercepts. Then, we can shade the region below the line to represent the solutions to the inequality.
