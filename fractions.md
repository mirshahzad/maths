A fraction is a numerical representation of a part of a whole. It is written using a numerator and a denominator separated by a line or a slash. The numerator represents the number of parts taken from the whole, while the denominator represents the total number of equal parts the whole is divided into or the total number of the same objects in a collection. Here are some examples of fractions:

Proper Fractions: A proper fraction is a fraction in which the numerator is less than the denominator. It represents a part of a single whole object. For example, 1/2, 2/3, and 3/4 are proper fractions.

Improper Fractions: An improper fraction is a fraction in which the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator. It represents a quantity greater than the whole. For example, 5/4, 7/3, and 11/2 are improper fractions.

Mixed Numbers: A mixed number is a whole number and a fraction. It represents a whole object and a part of another object. For example, 1 1/2, 2 3/4, and 3 2/5 are mixed numbers.

Unit Fractions: A unit fraction is a fraction whose numerator is one. It represents a part of one whole. For example, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4 are unit fractions.
Fractions are used in various real-life situations, such as cooking, construction, and measurement. They are also used in mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example, to add two fractions, we need to find a common denominator and then add the numerators. To divide two fractions, we need to invert the second fraction and then multiply. Fractions are an important concept in mathematics and have many applications in various fields.

To solve fractions, there are several methods and tools available. Here are some steps to solve fractions:
Addition and Subtraction of Fractions: To add or subtract fractions, they must have the same denominator. If they do, simply add or subtract the numerators together. For example, to solve 1/3 + 1/4, we need to find a common denominator, which is 12. Then, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 12, which gives us 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12. Similarly, to solve 6/8 - 2/8, we can simply subtract the numerators, which gives us 4/8. We can then simplify this fraction to 1/2.
Multiplication and Division of Fractions: To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. For example, to solve 2/3 x 3/4, we multiply 2 x 3 to get 6, and 3 x 4 to get 12. So, the answer is 6/12, which can be simplified to 1/2. To divide fractions, we invert the second fraction and then multiply. For example, to solve 2/3 รท 3/4, we invert 3/4 to get 4/3, and then multiply 2/3 x 4/3, which gives us 8/9.

Fraction Calculator: There are many online fraction calculators available that can help solve fractions. For example, MathPapa and Calculator Soup are two websites that offer fraction calculators. These calculators can add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions, and show the steps to solve the problem.
