Addition rules in probability are used to calculate the probability of either one or both of two events occurring. The addition rules are particularly useful in situations where we need to consider multiple outcomes or events simultaneously. Here are the basic addition rules:
1. Addition Rule for Mutually Exclusive Events: This rule is used when two events cannot occur simultaneously. In other words, if Event A occurs, Event B cannot occur at the same time. The probability of either Event A or Event B occurring is given by:
P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B)
For example, if you draw a single card from a deck of cards, the events "drawing a king" and "drawing an ace" are mutually exclusive. If you draw a king, you cannot also draw an ace at the same time. In this case, the probability of drawing a king or an ace is:
P(King or Ace) = P(King) + P(Ace) = 1/13 + 1/13 = 2/13
2. Addition Rule for Non-Mutually Exclusive Events: This rule is used when two events can occur simultaneously. The probability of either Event A or Event B occurring is given by:
P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)
For example, if you draw a single card from a deck of cards, the events "drawing a king" and "drawing a heart" are not mutually exclusive. You can draw a king of hearts, so the probability of drawing a king or a heart is:
P(King or Heart) = P(King) + P(Heart) - P(King and Heart) = 1/13 + 1/13 – 1/52 = 3/52
In real-life situations, addition rules in probability are used in various fields, such as insurance, where the occurrence of multiple claims by a policyholder can be analyzed using the addition rules. In the medical field, addition rules can be applied to determine the probability of a patient having a specific disease based on multiple test results or symptoms.
