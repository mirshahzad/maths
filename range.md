The range is a statistical measurement of dispersion, or how much a given data set is stretched out from smallest to largest. It is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a set of data. Here are some examples to help understand the concept of range:

Data set {4, 6, 9, 3, 7}: The lowest value is 3, and the highest is 9. So the range is 9 - 3 = 6.

Data set {8, 11, 5, 9, 7, 6, 3616}: The lowest value is 5, and the highest is 3616. So the range is 3616 - 5 = 3611. The single value of 3616 makes the range large, but most values are around 10. So we may be better off using Interquartile Range or Standard Deviation.

Function f(x) = x^2: The range of this function is all non-negative real numbers because any non-negative real number can be obtained as the output of the function. Therefore, the range is [0, ∞).

Function g(x) = 1/x: The range of this function is all real numbers except for 0 because division by zero is undefined. Therefore, the range is (-∞, 0) U (0, ∞).

Function h(x) = √(x-2): The range of this function is all non-negative real numbers because the square root of a non-negative number is always non-negative. Therefore, the range is [0, ∞).
