A quadratic equation is an equation of the second degree, meaning it contains at least one term that is squared. The standard form of a quadratic equation is ax² + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants, or numerical coefficients, and x is an unknown variable. Here are some examples of quadratic equations in standard form:
	6x² + 11x - 35 = 0
	2x² - 4x - 2 = 0
	-4x² - 7x +12 = 0
	20x² -15x - 10 = 0
	x² -x - 3 = 0
	5x² - 2x - 9 = 0
	3x² + 4x + 2 = 0
	-x² +6x + 18 = 0

Quadratic equations can also be written in non-standard forms, such as when the linear coefficient or the constant term is missing. Here are some examples of non-standard quadratic equations:
	2x² - 64 = 0
	x² - 16 = 0
	9x² + 49 = 0
	-2x² - 4 = 0
	4x² + 81 = 0
	-x² - 9 = 0
	3x² - 36 = 0
	6x² + 144 = 0
	x² - 7x = 0
	2x² + 8x = 0
	-x² - 9x = 0
	x² + 2x = 0
	-6x² - 3x = 0
	-5x² + x = 0
	-12x² + 13x = 0

To solve a quadratic equation, we need to find the values of the unknown variable x that make the equation true. There are several methods to solve quadratic equations, including factoring, completing the square, and using the quadratic formula. The solutions to a quadratic equation are called roots or zeros, and they can be real or complex numbers. The number of roots a quadratic equation has depends on the discriminant, which is the expression b² - 4ac that appears under the square root in the quadratic formula. If the discriminant is positive, the equation has two distinct real roots. If the discriminant is zero, the equation has one real root. If the discriminant is negative, the equation has two complex roots.
Quadratic Formula:

The quadratic formula is a formula that provides the two solutions, or roots, to a quadratic equation. It is used to solve any quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are coefficients. The quadratic formula is:
x=(-b±√(b^2-4ac))/2a

The plus-minus symbol "±" indicates that the quadratic equation has two solutions. The quadratic formula can be written separately as:
x=(-b+√(b^2-4ac))/2a
and
x=(-b-√(b^2-4ac))/2a

The quadratic formula is derived from completing the square technique, and it is the most efficient way to solve quadratic equations that cannot be easily factorized or solved by other methods. The formula gives the roots of the quadratic equation, which are the values of x that make the equation true. The number of roots a quadratic equation has depends on the discriminant, which is the expression b² - 4ac that appears under the square root in the quadratic formula. If the discriminant is positive, the equation has two distinct real roots. If the discriminant is zero, the equation has one real root. If the discriminant is negative, the equation has two complex roots.

Steps to solve a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
1. Write the quadratic equation in standard form: ax² + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are coefficients.
2. Identify the values of a, b, and c from the quadratic equation.
3. Substitute the values of a, b, and c into the quadratic formula: 
x=(-b±√(b^2-4ac))/2a
4. Simplify the expression under the square root by calculating b² - 4ac.
5. Determine the sign of the square root. If b² - 4ac is positive, there are two real roots. If b² - 4ac is zero, there is one real root. If b² - 4ac is negative, there are two complex roots.
6. Evaluate the two solutions by substituting the values of a, b, and c into the quadratic formula and simplifying.
7. Write the solutions as ordered pairs (x, y), where x is the value of the root and y is zero.
It is important to note that the quadratic formula is not the only method to solve quadratic equations. Other methods include factoring, completing the square, and graphing. However, the quadratic formula is a reliable and efficient method to solve any quadratic equation, especially when the equation cannot be easily factored or solved by other methods.
