Roots and radicals are mathematical concepts that involve finding the inverse of powers. A root is a number that, when multiplied by itself a certain number of times, gives us the number inside the radical symbol, which is called the radicand. The index of a root can be any positive integer, and it gives the name to the radical. Here are some examples of roots and radicals:
•	Square root: The square root of a number is a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. For example, the square root of 25 is 5, because 5 x 5 = 25.
•	Cube root: The cube root of a number is a number that, when multiplied by itself three times, gives the original number. For example, the cube root of 27 is 3, because 3 x 3 x 3 = 27.
•	Fourth root: The fourth root of a number is a number that, when multiplied by itself four times, gives the original number. For example, the fourth root of 16 is 2, because 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16.

When working with roots and radicals, there are some rules and properties to keep in mind:
•	As long as the index of the roots is the same, you can multiply or divide radicals with different numbers inside the root by combining them into one root and multiplying or dividing the numbers inside the root.
•	To add or subtract radicals, the number inside the roots must be the same. You add or subtract the numbers outside the root. To add or subtract radicals, you might need to simplify them first to find like terms.
•	When multiplying a number by a radical, the order of the factors does not matter, and the result should be the number followed by the radical.
•	You cannot add radicals with different numbers inside the root, but you can simplify them first to find like terms. For example, you can simplify √3 + √12 to √3 + 2√3, and then add them to get 3√3.
•	To simplify a radical, you can use the product rule for radicals to break down the radicand into factors that are perfect powers of the index. For example, to simplify √48, you can write it as √16 x √3, and then simplify √16 to 4 to get 4√3.
•	When taking the square root of a number, the answer can be positive or negative. A positive number times itself will yield a positive number, and a negative number times itself will also yield a positive number. To show the negative of a square root, a negative sign would have to be placed outside the radical.
•	When working with other roots, note that when the index is odd, a negative radicand can be produced by negative factors.
