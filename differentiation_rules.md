Differentiation rules in calculus provide a set of guidelines for finding the derivatives of different types of functions. These rules are essential for simplifying the process of finding derivatives and are widely used in various mathematical and real-world applications. Here are some examples of differentiation rules with real-life applications:
i.	Power Rule:
•	The power rule states that the derivative of a function of the form \( y = ax^n \) is given by \( \frac{dy}{dx} = n \times ax^{n-1} \).
•	Real-life Example: In physics, when analyzing the motion of an object, the power rule can be used to find the velocity of the object from its displacement function, where the exponent \( n \) represents the power of the displacement function.
ii.	Sum and Difference Rule:
•	The sum and difference rule states that the derivative of the sum or difference of two functions is equal to the sum or difference of their derivatives.
•	Real-life Example: When analyzing the total cost function in economics, the sum rule can be used to find the rate of change of the total cost with respect to the quantity produced.
iii.	Product Rule:
•	The product rule is used to find the derivative of the product of two functions.
•	Real-life Example: In engineering, the product rule can be applied to determine the rate of change of the power output of a machine with respect to the changes in its operating parameters.
iv.	Quotient Rule:
•	The quotient rule is used to find the derivative of the quotient of two functions.
•	Real-life Example: In finance, the quotient rule can be used to analyze the rate of change of a company's profit margin with respect to changes in its revenue.
These differentiation rules are fundamental in calculus and have practical applications in various fields, including physics, economics, engineering, and finance. They provide a systematic approach to finding derivatives and are essential for understanding the behavior of functions in real-world scenarios.
