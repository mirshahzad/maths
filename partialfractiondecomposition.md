Partial Fraction Decomposition
Partial fraction decomposition is a method used to decompose a rational expression into simpler partial fractions. It is used to simplify complex rational expressions and make them easier to integrate or differentiate. The process involves breaking down a fraction into simpler parts, each with a polynomial denominator. The partial fraction decomposition is useful in solving problems in calculus, engineering, and physics.

Here is an example:
Suppose we have the rational expression:
(3x + 2) / (x^2 - 4)

We want to decompose this expression into partial fractions.
•	Factor the denominator: (x^2 - 4) = (x + 2)(x - 2)
•	Write the partial fraction decomposition as:
(3x + 2) / (x^2 - 4) = A / (x + 2) + B / (x - 2)
•	Multiply both sides by the common denominator (x + 2)(x - 2):
(3x + 2) = A(x - 2) + B(x + 2)
•	Solve for A and B by substituting x = -2 and x = 2:
When x = -2, we get:
-4A = -4
A = 1
When x = 2, we get:
4B = 10
B = 5/2
•	Substitute the values of A and B back into the partial fraction decomposition:
(3x + 2) / (x^2 - 4) = 1 / (x + 2) + 5/2 / (x - 2)

Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition of the rational expression (3x + 2) / (x^2 - 4) is 1 / (x + 2) + 5/2 / (x - 2).
Partial fraction decomposition is a useful technique in calculus, engineering, and physics for simplifying complex rational expressions and making them easier to integrate or differentiate.
