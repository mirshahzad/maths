Integration rules are a set of mathematical rules used to integrate different types of functions. The most important integration rules include the power rule, integral of 1, integral of exponential functions, integral of trigonometric functions, and important rules such as the power rule, sum rule, difference rule, multiplication by constant, and product rule. Here are some practical examples of integration rules:

1. Power Rule: The power rule states that ∫x^n dx = x^(n+1)/(n+1) + C, where n is any real number except for -1. For example, ∫x^2 dx = x^3/3 + C.

2. Integral of Exponential Function: The integral of exponential functions follows the rule ∫e^x dx = e^x + C. For instance, ∫e^2x dx = (1/2)e^2x + C.

3. Integral of Trigonometric Function: The integral of trigonometric functions includes rules such as ∫cos(x) dx = sin(x) + C and ∫sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C. For example, ∫sin(3x) dx = -cos(3x)/3 + C.

These rules are essential for solving various integral problems and are used to find areas, volumes, central points, and other useful quantities. They provide a systematic way to perform integration and are crucial in calculus and mathematical analysis.
