A function in maths is a special relationship among the inputs (i.e. the domain) and their outputs (known as the codomain) where each input has exactly one output, and the output can be traced back to its input.

Types of Functions in Maths
An example of a simple function is f(x) = x2. In this function, the function f(x) takes the value of “x” and then squares it. For instance, if x = 3, then f(3) = 9. A few more examples of functions are: f(x) = sin x, f(x) = x2 + 3, f(x) = 1/x, f(x) = 2x + 3, etc.

There are several types of functions in maths. Some important types are:
•	Injective function or One to one function: When there is mapping for a range for each domain between two sets.
•	Surjective functions or Onto function: When there is more than one element mapped from domain to range.
•	Polynomial function: The function which consists of polynomials.
•	Inverse Functions: The function which can invert another function.

These were a few examples of functions. It should be noted that there are various other functions like into function, algebraic functions, etc.

Functions are mathematical tools that are widely used in real-life situations. Here are some examples of functions in real life:

Distance traveled by a car: If a car is traveling at a constant speed of 35 miles per hour, a function can be used to determine how far it has traveled after 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, etc. The function would look like: Miles driven = 35x, where x is equal to the number of hours.

Vending machines: A vending machine is a function machine where the user puts in money, punches a specific button, and a specific item drops into the output slot. The function here is the relationship between the input (money) and the output (item).

Taxes and tax brackets: Tax brackets are another example of a function. The relationship between tax and taxable income can be better understood by calculating the tax on a variety of different taxable incomes using functions.

Height of a golf ball: The height in feet of a golf ball hit into the air is given by the function h(t) = -16t^2 + 64t, where it is the number of seconds elapsed since the ball was hit.

Age and height: There is a relationship between age and height. People get taller with time and then remain at the same height for a while. This is a relation because if you input a specific age and check all the people of that age, you would get different heights.

Cost of fuel and taking a taxi: The cost of fuel and taking a taxi are examples of functions that can be modeled and solved using other functions.
