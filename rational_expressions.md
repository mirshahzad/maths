A polynomial is an expression that consists of a sum of terms containing integer powers of 
x, like 3x2-6x-1.

A rational expression is simply a quotient of two polynomials. Or in other words, it is a fraction whose numerator and denominator are polynomials.

These are examples of rational expressions:
	1/x  
	(x+5)/(x^2-4x+4)
	(x(x+1)(2x-3))/(x-6)
Notice that the numerator can be a constant and that the polynomials can be of varying degrees and in multiple forms.
