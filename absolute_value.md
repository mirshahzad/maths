In mathematics, the absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, always resulting in a positive value. It is represented by two vertical bars surrounding the number, such as |x|. For example, the absolute value of 5 is 5, and the absolute value of -5 is also 5. The absolute value of a number can be calculated by taking the number and dropping the negative sign if it has one. 

Here is an example: 
- Find the absolute value of -10. 

The absolute value of -10 is 10, since it is 10 units away from zero on the number line. Therefore, |-10| = 10.

Real Life Example:
The absolute value is used in various real-life situations to define the difference or change from one point to another. For instance, in physics and calculus, it is used to define certain situations such as determining how far something traveled when it went 5 ft. one way and 5 ft. back. The absolute value can also be used to show how much a value deviates from the norm. For example, an absolute value function can be used to determine how much a person's body temperature deviates from the normal temperature range. Additionally, the absolute value is used in determining the fuel economy of vehicles. It is also used in solving inequalities involving absolute values.
