Linear approximation is a method used to estimate the value of a function near a particular point by using the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. This technique is particularly useful when the exact calculation of a function's value is challenging, and a quick rough estimate is needed. The linear approximation is based on the idea that for small changes in the independent variable, the change in the function can be approximated by the change in the tangent line.
Example of Linear Approximation:
Consider the function \( f(x) = \sqrt{x+4} \). To approximate the value of \( f(6) \), which is difficult to compute exactly, we can use a linear approximation. First, we find the derivative of \( f(x) \) as \( f'(x) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x+4}} \). Then, the linear approximation to \( f \) at \( x=5 \) is given by \( L(x) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{5+4}}(x-5) + \sqrt{5+4} = \frac{x-5}{6} + 3 \). Using this linear approximation, we can estimate \( \sqrt{6+4} \) as \( \frac{6-5}{6} + 3 = \frac{1}{6} + 3 \approx 3.1667 \).
Real-life Scenario:
A real-life scenario where linear approximation is used is in engineering and physics. For instance, when dealing with small angles, the linear approximation of the trigonometric function \( \sin x \) at \( x=0 \) is \( L(x) = x \). This approximation simplifies calculations and is frequently used by engineers and scientists to estimate the behavior of systems under small perturbations.
