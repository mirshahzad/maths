Differentials in calculus refer to small changes in a function's variables and are closely related to derivatives. In real-life scenarios, differentials are used to approximate the change in a quantity due to small changes in its variables. Here are some examples and scenarios where differentials are applied:
Real-Life Examples and Scenarios of Differentials:
i.	Finance and Economics:
•	In finance, differentials are used to estimate the impact of small changes in interest rates, exchange rates, or commodity prices on investment portfolios and financial instruments.
•	For example, in risk management, differentials are used to assess the impact of small changes in market conditions on the value of derivative securities, such as options and futures contracts.
ii.	Physics and Engineering:
•	In physics and engineering, differentials are used to approximate the change in physical quantities, such as displacement, velocity, and acceleration, due to small changes in time or other variables.
•	For instance, in mechanical engineering, differentials are used to estimate the change in velocity or acceleration of a moving object in response to small changes in external forces or conditions.
iii.	Population Growth Models:
•	Differential equations, which involve differentials, are used to model population growth and decay in biology and ecology. These models help predict the change in population size over time due to small changes in birth rates, death rates, or environmental factors.
iv.	Risk Management and Hedging:
•	In business and economics, differentials are used in risk management and hedging strategies to estimate the impact of small changes in market conditions on the value of assets, liabilities, and financial contracts.
