Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with the occurrence of random events. It is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring and is expressed as a value between 0 and 1. Probability is used to predict the outcomes of various events, such as tossing coins, rolling dice, or drawing cards from a deck of cards. There are two main types of probability: theoretical probability and empirical probability. Theoretical probability is based on a theoretical model, while empirical probability is based on the frequency of occurrence of an event in a set of trials.

Key concepts in probability include:
•	Sample space: The set of possible outcomes for an experiment or event.
•	Event: A specific outcome or set of outcomes that can occur in an experiment or event.
•	Favorable outcomes: The number of outcomes in an event that are favorable to the occurrence of a particular event.
•	Total outcomes: The total number of possible outcomes in an experiment or event.

The probability of an event (E) is calculated using the formula:
P(E) = n(E) / n(S)

where n(E) is the number of favorable outcomes and n(S) is the total number of outcomes in the sample space.

Here are some examples of probability:
1.	Coin toss: When a coin is tossed, there are two possible outcomes: heads or tails. The probability of getting heads is 1/2, and the probability of getting tails is also 1/2.
2.	Rolling a dice: When a dice is rolled, there are 6 possible outcomes, ranging from 1 to 6. The probability of rolling a specific number is 1/6, or approximately 11.67%.
3.	Drawing a card from a deck of cards: When a card is drawn from a deck of cards, there are 52 possible outcomes. The probability of drawing a specific card is 1/52, or approximately 1.85%.

Probability has various applications in real life, such as predicting the outcomes of random events, making decisions under uncertainty, and understanding the underlying assumptions of statistical models.

Probability in Real World Scenarios:

Probability is used in various real-world scenarios to make informed decisions, predict outcomes, and understand the likelihood of events occurring. Here are some examples of how probability is used in real life:
•	Weather forecasting: Probability is used by weather forecasters to assess the likelihood of rain, snow, or clouds on a given day in a certain area.
•	Sports outcomes: Probability is used to predict the outcomes of sports events, such as games or matches. For example, a sports betting company may determine the probability of one team winning over another and offer different payouts based on those probabilities.
•	Card games and other games of chance: Probability is used to determine the odds of winning in games like poker or blackjack.
•	Insurance: Probability is used by insurance companies to determine the likelihood of a policyholder filing a claim and the potential cost of that claim. This information is used to set insurance premiums.
•	Politics: Probability is used by political forecasters to predict the chances of certain candidates winning various elections.
•	Natural disasters: Probability is used by environmental departments of countries to determine the likelihood of natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, or earthquakes striking the country in a given year.
•	Stock market: Probability is used by stock market traders to predict the likelihood of a particular stock's price increasing or decreasing.
•	Online shopping: Probability is used by online retailers to predict the likelihood of a customer purchasing a specific product based on factors like age, gender, location, and browsing history.
•	Traffic forecasting: Probability is used by transportation departments to predict the likelihood of traffic congestion during specific times or in specific areas.
•	Medicine: Probability is used in medical research to determine the likelihood of a patient responding to a specific treatment or the likelihood of a disease progressing in a certain way.
