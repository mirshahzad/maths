Permutation in probability refers to the arrangement of objects in a specific order. In real-life scenarios, permutation can be observed in various situations, such as arranging a playlist, seating arrangements, or assigning tasks to individuals. 
For example, consider a scenario where a teacher wants to select a president, vice president, and secretary from a group of 10 students. The order in which the students are selected matters. The number of ways to select the three positions can be calculated using permutation. 
The number of ways to select the president is 10, then the number of ways to select the vice president from the remaining 9 students is 9, and finally, the number of ways to select the secretary from the remaining 8 students is 8. Therefore, the total number of ways to select the three positions is given by the product of these numbers, which is 720 (10 × 9 × 8).
