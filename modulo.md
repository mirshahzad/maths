Modulo is a mathematical operation that finds the remainder when one integer is divided by another. It is frequently abbreviated as mod or represented by the symbol %. For example, 11 mod 4 = 3, because 11 divides by 4 (twice), with 3 remaining. 

The modulo operation is used in various fields, including computer science, cryptography, and number theory.

Here are some examples of modulo in mathematics:
Clock Arithmetic: With a modulus of 12, we can make a clock with numbers 1 to 12. We start at 1 and go through 24 numbers in a clockwise sequence 1, 2, 3, ..., 12, 1, 2, 3, .... If it is 14 o'clock, we can find the time by taking 14 mod 12, which equals 2. So 14 o'clock becomes 2 o'clock.

Hash Tables: In programming, taking the modulo is how you can fit items into a hash table. If your table has N entries, convert the item key to a number, do mod N, and put the item in that bucket (perhaps keeping a linked list there). As your hash table grows in size, you can recompute the modulo for the keys.

Picking a Random Item: Suppose we have 4 people playing a game and need to pick someone to go first. We can use the mod N mini-game by giving people numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3. Then we can pick a random number, say 7, and take 7 mod 4, which equals 3. So the person with number 3 goes first.

Modular Congruence: In number theory, we often want to focus on whether two integers, say a and b, have the same remainder when divided by m. This is the idea behind modular congruence. If n is a positive integer, then integers a and b are congruent modulo n if they have the same remainder when divided by n. For example, 7 and 4 are congruent modulo 3 because their difference 7-4 = 3 is a multiple of 3.
