The mean, also known as the average, is a measure of central tendency in statistics. It is calculated by adding up all the numbers in a data set and then dividing by the total number of values. For example, the mean of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 is calculated as follows: (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6. Another example is the mean of 3, 5, 9, 5, 7, and 2, which is calculated as (3 + 5 + 9 + 5 + 7 + 2) / 6 = 31 / 6 = 5.17. In finance, the mean is used to understand the performance of a company’s stock price over a period of time. The mean is represented by the symbol X̄ and is calculated as the sum of values divided by the number of values in the data set. There are different types of mean, including arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean. The arithmetic mean is the most commonly used type, calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values.
