The Mean Value Theorem (MVT) states that if a function ( f) is continuous on the closed interval ([a, b]) and differentiable on the open interval ((a, b)), then there exists a point ( c) in the interval ((a, b)) such that ( f'(c)) is equal to the function's average rate of change over ([a, b]). In other words, the graph has a tangent somewhere in ((a, b)) that is parallel to the secant line over ([a, b]).
A practical example of the Mean Value Theorem can be illustrated with a function ( f(x) = x^2) over the interval. The average rate of change of ( f(x)) over this interval is (frac{f(3) - f(1)}{3 - 1} = frac{9 - 1}{2} = 4). According to the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point ( c) in ((1, 3)) such that ( f'(c) = 4), where ( f'(x)) is the derivative of (f(x)).
Another example is finding the number that satisfies the Mean Value Theorem for ( f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 8) over the interval. In this case, the Mean Value Theorem doesn't guarantee any particular value or set of values, but it states that for any closed interval over which a function is continuous, there exists some ( x) within that interval at which the slope of the tangent equals the slope of the secant line defined by the interval endpoints.
The Mean Value Theorem has practical applications in various fields, such as physics, economics, and engineering, where it can be used to analyze rates of change and average values of quantities.
