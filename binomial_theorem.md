The binomial theorem is a formula that describes the expansion of powers of a binomial, which is a polynomial with two terms. The theorem states that it is possible to expand the polynomial (a + b)^n into a sum of terms of the form a^k b^(n-k), where k is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n. The coefficients of these terms are given by the binomial coefficients, which are the numbers that appear in Pascal's triangle. The binomial coefficients can be calculated using the formula nCk = n! / (k! (n-k)!), where n is a non-negative integer and k is an integer between 0 and n.

Here is an example of the binomial theorem:
â€¢	(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3. This expansion has four terms, and the coefficients are 1, 3, 3, and 1, respectively.

The binomial theorem has many applications in mathematics, physics, and engineering. For example, it is used to calculate the probabilities of events in statistics, to approximate the solutions of differential equations, and to model the behavior of electrical circuits.
