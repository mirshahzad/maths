A variable is an alphabet or term that represents an unknown number or unknown value or unknown quantity. The variables are specially used in the case of algebraic expression or algebra. 
For example, x + 9 = 4 is a linear equation where x is a variable, where 9 and 4 are constants.

Example: 3x + 9 = 21
 •	X is  variable
 •	3 is a coefficient of x
 •	9 and 21 are constants
 •	+ is an operator
