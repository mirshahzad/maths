A histogram is a type of graph that displays the distribution of continuous data using bars of different heights. It is similar to a bar chart, but instead of showing individual data points, it groups them into ranges or bins. Histograms are commonly used to show the frequency distribution of data, such as the distribution of heights, weights, or test scores. For example, a histogram can be used to show the distribution of heights of students in a class, with the x-axis representing the height ranges and the y-axis representing the frequency of students in each range. Another example is a histogram that shows the distribution of salaries in a company, with the x-axis representing the salary ranges and the y-axis representing the number of employees in each range. Histograms are useful for identifying patterns and trends in data, such as the presence of outliers or skewness in the data. They are easy to create and interpret, but the choice of bin size can affect the appearance of the histogram and the conclusions drawn from it. Histograms are commonly used in various fields, such as statistics, finance, and science.
