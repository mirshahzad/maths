Quantifiers are used to express the quantities without giving an exact number.
Example: all, some, many, none, few, etc.

Sentences like: 	Can I have some water?
			            Jack has many friends here.

Definition 2: Words, expressions, or phrases that indicate the number of elements that a statement pertains to.

Types:
•	Universal Quantifiers
•	Existential Quantifiers

Example: Let P(x) be a statement x+1 > x
P(1): 1+1 > 1 = 2 > 1 (True)
P(2): 2+1 > 2 = 3 > 2 (True)
.
.
.	for all the integers x
P(x) is true for all true integers x or
∀x (P(x)

Example 2: Let Q(x) be the statement x < 2
Q(1): 1<2 (True)
Q(2): 2<2 (False)
.
.
.	all are false

Question: 	Is there some value of x for which Q(x) is True?
		        [If the domain is set of +ve integers]
Answer: Yes. Q(x) is true for x = 1
Therefore, there is an x for which Q(x) is true.
OR
∃x Q(x)

In mathematical logic, there are two quantifiers (i) there exists ∃ (ii) for all ∀

Existential quantifiers ∃: Indicate that at least one element exists that satisfies a certain property.

Universal quantifiers ∀: Indicate that all of the elements of a given set satisfy a property.
